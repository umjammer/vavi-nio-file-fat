# ipod package

Those classes were used to recover MP3 files from an iPod Classic after I accidentally deleted all of them.
As far as I remember, I managed to salvage 100% of the files and 99% of the data.
The remaining 1% involved some uncertainty around the MP3 trailer sectors,
but when I listened to the recovered files, I couldn’t find any corruption.

In other words, I was able to restore all my MP3s,
making those classes a great example of data recovery and forensic techniques.

At the time, I used a Windows PC, so the code includes native functions for raw disk access.
