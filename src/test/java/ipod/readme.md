# ipod package

those classes were used for salvaging mp3 files in the ipod classic those i accidentally deleted all.
afa i remember, i salvaged 100% files and 99% of data. lest 1% is there were some uncertain part around
mp3 trailer sectors. but listening those, i couldn't find cracked part.

that means i could save all my mp3s. so those classes are quite good sample of salvage or forensics.

at that time i used a windows pc so, native code is included for raw disk access.
